# Bayes webapp base

Clone this repo as a easy starter template for frontend projects. Angular and D3 and twitter boostrap is already included.

## Getting started

    brew install node
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install

And then run the development server with

    gulp

You can install dependencies (like d3) by running

    npm install --save d3

The setup is inspired by: https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter


## project layout

All your `CSS`, `JS`, `frontend assets (e.g.: images)` and `static data` goes into the `src` folder. I included examples of how to use theses assets in your app.
