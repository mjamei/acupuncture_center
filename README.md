# Bayes webapp base

Clone this repo as a easy starter template for frontend projects. Angular and D3 and twitter boostrap is already included.

## Getting started

If you're on a Mac, make sure you have XCode installed. You can find it in the App Store. After installing, you have to run Xcode once first, accept terms when asked, and let it install components. Now you should be good to go.

    brew install node
    npm install -g gulp
    npm install

And then run the development server with

    gulp

You can install dependencies (like d3) by running

    npm install --save d3

The setup is inspired by: https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter


## project layout

All your `CSS`, `JS`, `frontend assets (e.g.: images)` and `static data` goes into the `src` folder. I included examples of how to use theses assets in your app.
